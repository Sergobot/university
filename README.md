This repository holds all of the code I wrote while (and as part of) studying in Saint Petersburg State University.
The structure goes as follows:

* **First year**
    * [Introduction to C](year-1/introduction-to-c): A 2-semester long introduction course to C, where we were taught the very basics of it and some of the slightly more advanced stuff.

* **Second year**
    * [Introduction to Java](year-2/introduction-to-java): This course has taught us quite a bit of writing things in Java. Matrix multiplication may not sound too entertaining, but I had a lot of fun trying to make my code faster than others. Pro tip: just find a fancy algorithm :P
    * [lattice](year-2/lattice): This is my course work for the second year. If you're unfamiliar with the concept, I'll explain: for me and my fellow students it was all about collaborating with someone from the faculty staff and trying to do our own research. I decided to make a universal program to compute [percolation thresholds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_threshold) for different lattices (hence the name). To learn more about the progress, check out the [source repository](https://github.com/Sergobot/lattice).
    * [Computational Workshop](year-2/computational-workshop): As part of this course, I needed to implement a few types of interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, as well as methods to solve systems of non-linear equations. It felt fastinating to learn the basics behind these things and then to tralslate mathematical concepts and formulas into code!

As of May 2020 I'm still a sophomore student. There will be two more promising years of studying and I can't wait to add more projects here :)
